Raspberry Pi First Setup
==========================

To install the Raspberry Pi system image, you will need a another computer with a SD card reader. For Raspi-Railway we will be using the Raspbian operating system.

## Download the image

The official image file for the Raspbian operating system is available to download from the Raspberry Pi website: [raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)

After downloading the .zip file, unzip it to get the image file (.img) for writing to your SD card.

## Writing an image to the SD card

With the Raspbian image file, you need to use an image writing tool to install it on your SD card.

See our guide for your system:
- [Windows](raspberry-pi-windows-install.md)
- [Mac OS](raspberry-pi-mac-install.md)

## Establish an SSH Connection to your Raspberry Pi
