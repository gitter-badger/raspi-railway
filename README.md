# raspi-railway
Raspberry Pi based control system for model railways

## Train Control
raspi-railway is a method of controlling model trains using affordable and widley avalible components in a typical "DC" model railway layout. At it's very basic level raspi-railway may be used as an advanced train controller, However...

## Automated Train Control
raspi-railway may also be used to control multiple trains in automated routes. By installing simple, affordable and widely availble electronic components to your layout (don't worry, we'll provide installation examples here!) raspi-railway may select different routes for your trains, stop them at stations and observe signalling... which may also be controlled via raspi-railway.

## Enviromental Scenic Control
An expandable and adaptable controller for scenic, sound and lighting effects that has the abilty to observe it's environmental conditions and as a result change the behaviour of the scenic effects it controls and the trains on your layout. If that sounds overly complex, don't worry you may also simply use it to make LED lights flicker like an open fire, or model house lights turn on and off!

## Automation. Direct Control. Interaction
raspi-railway will offer you direct control over the trains, lights, sound effects and animations on your layout. If you wish it will take control away from you and allow you to enjoy the show. However if you're prepared to experiment It will interact with your trains, your environment and you!
